# DSA
Data Structure and Algorithm


## Algorithm 
A set of steps or instructions for completing a task.

### properties of Algorithm
1. clearly defined problem statement, input and output.
2. The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order 
3. The steps also need to be distinct.
4. The algorithm should produce a result.
5. The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.
